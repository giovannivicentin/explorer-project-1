# Explorer Project 1

## Overview

Welcome to the first project of the Explore Course by Rocketseat. This project is designed to introduce foundational web development concepts, focusing on HTML and CSS. It's a hands-on project where you'll learn by doing, creating a visually appealing and functionally robust webpage.

### Key Learning Points

- **HTML Tags**: Understanding both inline and block-type tags.
- **CSS Concepts**: Delving into selectors, main attributes, and the use of fonts.
- **Layout Techniques**: Learning about `align-items`, `position` and other layout-centric properties.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository and explore the files. The main HTML file is structured with various tags, each serving a specific purpose in the layout. The CSS file contains styles that are applied to these tags, using selectors to manipulate their appearance and behavior.
